**EXPERIMENTAL** Staticman branch

This branch will be used to experiment with integrating with the [staticman](https://staticman.net) project, a useful tool for static sites such as github pages that will allow user generated content, in this case GDPR DPIAs, to be committed into a GitHub repository.

A free web-based Data Protection Impact Assessment Tool to assist organisations to evaluate data protection risks with respect to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The questions used within this tool were originally produced by the A4Cloud project, the original questionnaire is available [here](Data%20Protection%20Impact%20Assessment.pdf).

An instance of the tool is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://simonarnell.github.io/GDPRDPIAT/) for preview.

*DISCLAIMER* Please use this only for what it is intended, a first pass assessment, seek separate legal and privacy advice for a more formal assessment of your organisationâ€™s position. I accept no liability.
